# CLI
A mono repo to contain commands for binaries grouped/named by directory per binary

New issue to ensure any "sensitive" information is not committed as well as abstraction of paths, names, urls, etc... using env vars

# IDE
#### VS Code
Deviates as these are vs code settings (not cli), contains preferred settings, keybindings, etc...
